## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone is a web application developed as part of my web development portfolio. The goal of this project was to replicate some of the core features and design of the popular Airbnb platform.

The project demonstrates my skills in front-end and back-end web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and database management.
